## [Project 1: Piloting an UR10E robot with body gesture with Mediapipe/Python/ROS](https://github.com/JustinBaheu/Mediapipe_ROS_Project)
My thesis subject of my 6 months internship at UNIMORE University of Modena,Italia constited in creating a informatic program to catch position of the user with a webcam, detect what kind of position the user is making and depending on that, move the UR10E Robot. As we say, 'one picture worth a thousand words', you can check the final test video here : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w5VgjV3_ha-61Da7t3WNPMw6gN6Anj2m/view

- Step 1 : Catching the data of the position that the user is making on the webcam screen using mediapipe (https://mediapipe.dev/) and OpenCV.
- Step 2 : Create a loop to build the training dataset with the coordinates of the dots showing on the webcam screen of the user.
- Step 3 : Build an Machine learning model to predict the futur position that the user will make on the screen. And evaluate the accurancy of it.
- Step 4 : Create a ROS node to define what kind of mouvement the robot  will make (Go straight, turn right...) for each position setted up before.
- Step 5 : Enjoy piloting a robot by distance only with gesture recognition ;)
